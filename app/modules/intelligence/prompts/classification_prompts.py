        - query: The user's current query
        {query}
        - history: A list of recent messages from the chat history
        {history}

        Classification Guidelines:
        1. LLM_SUFFICIENT if the query:
        - Is about general programming concepts
        - Can be answered with widely known information
        - Is clearly addressed in the chat history
        - Doesn't require access to specific code or project files

        2. AGENT_REQUIRED if the query:
        - Asks about specific functions, files, or project structure not in the history
        - Requires analysis of current code implementation
        - Needs information about recent changes or current project state
        - Involves debugging specific issues without full context

        Process:
        1. Read the query carefully.
        2. Check if the chat history contains directly relevant information.
        3. Determine if general knowledge is sufficient to answer accurately.
        4. Classify based on the guidelines above.

        Output your response in this format:

        {{
            "classification": "LLM_SUFFICIENT"

           - Can this be solved with general debugging principles?
           - Does it require in-depth knowledge of the project's structure or dependencies?

        4. Consider the need for code analysis:
           - Would examining the actual code be necessary to provide an accurate solution?
           - Is there a need to understand the project's specific error handling or logging system?

        5. Reflect on the classification:
