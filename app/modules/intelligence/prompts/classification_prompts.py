        Given:
        - query: The user's current query
        {query}
        - history: A list of recent messages from the chat history
        {history}

        Classification Guidelines:
        1. LLM_SUFFICIENT if the query:
        - Is about general programming concepts
        - Can be answered with widely known information
        - Is clearly addressed in the chat history
        - Doesn't require access to specific code or project files

        2. AGENT_REQUIRED if the query:
        - Asks about specific functions, files, or project structure not in the history
        - Requires analysis of current code implementation
        - Needs information about recent changes or current project state
        - Involves debugging specific issues without full context

        Process:
        1. Read the query carefully.
        2. Check if the chat history contains directly relevant information.
        3. Determine if general knowledge is sufficient to answer accurately.
        4. Classify based on the guidelines above.

        Output your response in this format:
        Classification: [LLM_SUFFICIENT or AGENT_REQUIRED]
        Reason: [Brief explanation for your classification]

        Examples:
        1. Query: "What is a decorator in Python?"
        Classification: LLM_SUFFICIENT
        Reason: This is a general Python concept that can be explained without specific project context.

        2. Query: "Why is the login function in auth.py returning a 404 error?"
        Classification: AGENT_REQUIRED
        Reason: This requires examination of specific project code and current behavior, which the LLM doesn't have access to.

        Personas:
        1. The Error Analyst: Specializes in understanding error messages and stack traces.
        2. The Code Detective: Focuses on identifying when code-specific analysis is needed.
        3. The Context Evaluator: Assesses the need for project-specific information.

        Given:
        - query: The user's current debugging query
        - history: A list of recent messages from the chat history

        Classification Process:
        1. Analyze the query:
           - Does it contain specific error messages or stack traces?
           - Is it asking about a particular piece of code or function?

        2. Evaluate the chat history:
           - Has relevant debugging information been discussed recently?
           - Are there any mentioned code snippets or error patterns?

        3. Assess the complexity:
           - Can this be solved with general debugging principles?
           - Does it require in-depth knowledge of the project's structure or dependencies?

        4. Consider the need for code analysis:
           - Would examining the actual code be necessary to provide an accurate solution?
           - Is there a need to understand the project's specific error handling or logging system?

        5. Reflect on the classification:
           - How confident are you in your decision?
           - What additional information could alter your classification?

        Classify the query into one of two categories:
        1. LLM_SUFFICIENT: The debugging query can be addressed using the LLM's knowledge and chat history.
        2. AGENT_REQUIRED: The debugging query requires additional context or specialized knowledge from a debugging agent.

        Final Thoughts: [Overall justification for the classification]

        Examples:
        1. Query: "I'm getting a 'KeyError' in Python. How do I fix it?"
           Classification: LLM_SUFFICIENT
           Confidence: High
           Reasoning:
           - Error Analyst: KeyError is a common Python exception that can be explained generally.
           - Code Detective: No specific code is mentioned, so general advice can be provided.
           - Context Evaluator: This error is not project-specific and can be addressed with general Python knowledge.

           Classification: AGENT_REQUIRED
           Confidence: High
           Reasoning:
           - Error Analyst: While NullPointerException is common, its cause is specific to the implementation.
           - Code Detective: We need to examine the processOrder() method to identify the null reference.
           - Context Evaluator: This requires understanding of the OrderService class and its dependencies.
           Final Thoughts: To accurately debug this issue, we need to analyze the specific code in OrderService.java, which requires the debugging agent's capabilities.
