Potpie parses and understands your codebase by building a knowledge graph out of your codeâ€™s components. 
It provides pre-built agents that are expert on your codebase to perform common engineering tasks for you, and also provides the platform for you to build your own custom agents.

## What are Codebase Agents?

AI agents are autonomous tools that have the ability to reason, take decisions and perform actions on their own. They are provided with 'tools' that they can use to perform tasks. Agents are iterative in nature and build on top of the results of the previous iteration in order to perform any task assigned to them. 

Software development is a similarly iterative process and agents can be used to automate and optimize key aspects of software development.
Things that developers do daily, like dbugging, can be broken down into a series of iterative steps that can be automated by agents.
For example, debugging can be broken down into:
1. Understanding the stacktrace
2. Understanding the code around the stacktrace
3. Coming up with a hypothesis
4. Testing the hypothesis
5. Repeating the above steps until the bug is fixed

In order to perform these steps, an agent would need to understand the codebase, the code around the stacktrace, the flow of the code, the project structure etc. 

Potpie parses your codebase and builds a graph tracking relationships between functions, files, classes, etc. We generate inferences for each node and embed and store it in the graph. This can be used to curate the correct context by performing a similarity search based on users query. The graph can also be queried to understand the code flow, it can be queried to understand the project structure etc. 

This allows Potpie's agents to understand the codebase and reason about the code.

## Potpie's Prebuilt Agents

Potpie offers a suite of specialized codebase agents for automating and optimizing key aspects of software development:

- **Debugging Agent**: Automatically analyzes stacktraces and provides debugging steps specific to your codebase.
- **Codebase Q&A Agent**: Answers questions about your codebase and explains functions, features, and architecture.
- **Code Changes Agent**: Analyzes code changes, identifies affected APIs, and suggests improvements before merging.
- **Integration Test Agent**: Generates integration test plans and code for flows to ensure components work together properly.
- **Unit Test Agent**: Automatically creates unit test plan and code for individual functions to enhance test coverage.
- **LLD Agent**: Creates a low level design for implementing a new feature by providing functional requirements to this agent.

Potpie's agents leverage tools that interact with your codebase's knowledge graph stored in neo4j. These tools look up project structure, fetch code from github, fetch code flow from graph etc

### Potpie's Tooling System

Potpie provides a set of tools that agents can use to interact with the knowledge graph and the underlying infrastructure. These tools are vital for creating custom agents and for performing highly contextual tasks with precision.

#### Available Tools:
- **get_code_from_probable_node_name**: Retrieves code snippets based on a probable node name.
- **get_code_from_node_id**: Fetches code associated with a specific node ID.
- **get_code_from_multiple_node_ids**: Retrieves code snippets for multiple node IDs simultaneously.
- **ask_knowledge_graph_queries**: Executes vector similarity searches to obtain relevant information from the knowledge graph.
- **get_nodes_from_tags**: Retrieves nodes tagged with specific keywords from the knowledge graph.
- **get_code_graph_from_node_id/name**: Fetches code graph structures for a specific node ID or name.
- **change_detection**: Detects changes in the current branch compared to the default branch.


These tools are the foundation for the custom agents you create, allowing them to intelligently access and manipulate your codebase efficiently.

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed instructions on setting up Potpie and making your first agent work for you!

Once you have set up Potpie, you can get started with the following steps:

## Step 1: Logging in to get a bearer token
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/login' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}'
```
## Step 2: Submit a Parsing Request
Replace the repo name and branch name with the repo you want to talk to.
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/parse' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "repo_name": "owner/repo-name",
  "branch_name": "branch-name"
}'
```
## Step 3: Check Parsing Status
Use the project id generated from previous request.
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/parsing-status/project-id' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
## Step 4: List Available Agents
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/list-available-agents/?list_system_agents=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
## Step 5: Create a Conversation
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/conversations/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "user_id": "your_user_id",
  "title": "Conversation Title",
  "status": "active",
  "project_ids": [
    "project_id"
  ],
  "agent_ids": [
    "agent_id"
  ]
}'
```
## Step 6: Send Messages in a Conversation

This API returns a stream response for the
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/conversations/1234/message/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "content": "Your message content here",
  "node_ids": [
    {
      "node_id": "node_identifier",
      "name": "node_name"
    }
  ]
}'
```
## Step 7: Get all the messages of a conversation
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8001/api/v1/conversations/conversation-id/
  messages/?start=0&limit=10' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

## Make Potpie Your Own

Potpie is designed to be flexible and customizable. Here are key areas to personalize your own deployment:

### 1. System Prompts Configuration

Modify the system prompts to align with your organization's tone and terminology.

**Edit Prompt Text**: In `app/modules/intelligence/prompts/system_prompt_setup.py`, update the `system_prompts` lists to change the text for each agent.

### 2. Add New Agents
**Add New Agents**: Create new agents by referring existing agents in the `app/modules/intelligence/agents/chat_agents` and `app/modules/intelligence/agents/agentic_tools` directory.

### 3. Agent Behavior Customization

Adjust existing agent behaviors to suit your operational needs.

**Modify Guidelines**: Change the guidelines within each agent's prompt to emphasize specific aspects of your codebase. You can do this by editing the prompts in the crewai agents in the `app/modules/intelligence/agents` directory.


### 4. Tool Integration

Customize which tools are available to each agent based on your requirements.

**Edit existing tools**: Edit tools for your usecase by refactoring the existing tools in the `app/modules/intelligence/tools` directory.

**Add New Tools**: Add new tools by referring existing tools in the `app/modules/intelligence/tools` directory.


By customizing system prompts, agent behaviors, and tool integrations you can tailor Potpie to effectively meet your organization's unique needs and enhance your software development processes.
